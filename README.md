# Rapid Climate Change
Contains the final assignment for Scientific Narration & Visualization course of MediaTechnology MSc. For this course a processing sketch was created that 
contained a small simulated population. The size of individuals in the population is influenced by the ambient temperature, making the population evolve.

### The simulation rules
Every individual behaves according to these rules:
- At birth a static amount of energy is awarded
- Every frame being alive costs a little bit of energy
- Every %birthrate% amount of frames they have a chance to make a child.
- Every frame they try to keep their temperature to 37 celsius, expending energy to keep it there.
- They get heated up or cooled down by the ambient temperature.
- Children get the size of their parents with a small mutation rate.
